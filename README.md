# Python Research & Development

This is a sandbox for Python research and development, typically for interview coding questions, and a place to store this
code publicly along with my notes for future reference.

The code is written under a time constraint, using the minimum code amount and minimum time to get an answer. This means
that not all edge cases are covered and parts might be broken. This is intentional, as the goal is to get a working
solution as fast as possible, replicating what happens in actual coding interviews. Some of these questions I have
been asked in real, actual interviews so feel free to reference, learn, contribute, or use this code for your own.

## Getting Started

This is a Python 3.102 project. Simply install that, install requirements.txt, and run the code.

You can use venv and the following commands to get started if you wish. This will configure a local python environment and install the requirements specific and local to this project only.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, feel free to poke around and try out the code.

## Contributing

This is a personal project for my own research and development, but if you want and have the passion,
feel free to open an issue or a PR, ping me and I will take a look!
