# Python Research & Development

This is a sandbox for Python research and development, and a place to store this code in a public forumn. I typically will dive into understanding conventional algorithms and data structures but typically always with a twist. 

This means the code might be dirty, it might be broken, it might not follow best practices, but it is for my brain to process and learn unique concepts not readily available in the wild. 

## Getting Started

This is a Python 3.10+ project. Simply install that, install requirements.txt, and run the code.

You can use venv and the following commands to get started if you wish. This will configure a local python environment and install the requirements specific and local to this project only.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, feel free to poke around and try out the code.

## Contributing

I am not really looking for contributions at this time.
This is a personal project for my own research and development, but if you want and have the passion,
feel free to open an issue or a PR, ping me and I will take a look!
